    I migrated key systems from a monolith structure to a Ruby & Scala microservice architecture, as well as assisted in improving existing services by adding bug fixes, error detection, and schema validation. I'm also owning the development of a brand new microservice used in production to monitor, compare, and analyze the effectiveness of both legacy and microservice architectures.
